      <h1>Our Aim</h1>
      
      <p>We are a team focussed to aid orphanages, specially-abled children and children of slums. Our senior members of the society - living in old-age homes - share stories to help us learn, which we incorporate with ideas from young minds to set goals for our organisation and provide the best possible aid to the society.

        Our seed sown in December 2018 has now transformed into a tree, spreading its branches across Kolkata and its suburbs. We also understand the importance of the environment and hence follow a norm to plant a tree or a basic shrub where we visit. This is our unique way of remembrance.
        
        We are sincerely indebted to the ones who are supporting us in form of donations as well as volunteering in events. Their support is the sole reason we grew and reached a zenith of having 20 active members as of March 2020.
        
        We look forward to have you onboard with us on our incessant yet beautiful journey to make the society a better place.

           <strong>Location:</strong> Bediapara, North Dumdum, Kolkata, West Bengal 700065
            
            Aashiyana Happy Homes is an orphanage, located at Bediapara, Kolkata. There are 195 children with an average age of 11 years. Their caretaker Mr David informed us that most children have never had a health checkup and were taken to a doctor only when they found extremely necessary.
            
            We held a medical camp with a team of 4 doctors from SSKM Hospital and organised some entertainment for the children while they were being diagnosed. We found that children had problems like malnutrition and worm infestation for which the team of doctors wrote them prescriptions and tests to be done and reported to them over Whatsapp. We supplied some basic medications as DeWorm and other sanitary items as well as aiding to their food requirements.
            
            ABCD is proud to hold the first medical camp in the history of Aashiyana Happy Homes for children.

            Govindo Old Age Home is an old-age home in Anandapur to the north of Ruby in Kolkata. 32 senior members are living there who have amazing stories to share, some have travelled over 15 countries to every corner of the world, some are there to spend their old-age with other similar members and some by their children. The insight they share with experience of life gives us immense knowledge over books and media as well as gives us valuable lessons needed to lead a better life.
            We celebrated Republic Day with them hoisting the national flag and saluting the noble warriors who were once their fathers and grandfathers. Our company gave them immense joy as they had someone that day to hear about their laurels and plight.

            On 25th of December 2019 we visited Pratham Padakshep welfare society.  This society aids mentally challenged kids and help them get a better future. We were pleased to see how they handle their children and even involve their parents in the process . Thank you Sonali maam  who is in charge of the society to help us and guide us. We celebrated Christmas eve with them as well as our first birthday (a little in advance). We distributed individual presents to make them feel special, we showed them a performance on calisthenics and also did some Yoga exercises with laughter therapy. They voluntarily sung a song for us followed by a dance performance.

            Mother’s Nest is a school for the unprivileged whose families live in huts or slums, they usually have only one earning member working as a street hawker, peddler, hand-rickshaw puller or daily-wage labour. With no job security and no financial support, they aim to educate their children . Mother’s Nest with a team of teachers started this organisation in Maniktala.
            
            We celebrated Diwali with them where the children had a gala time lighting the sparkler sticks, whirlgigs (chakri) and flowerpots followed by a full meal including drinks, snacks and sweets.  
            
             
            
            COVID-19 UPDATE: ABCD is still in contact with them by providing daily essentials to them who have lost their means to earn.
